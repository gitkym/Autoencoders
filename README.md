Demo of simple AE and VAE.

There are two notebooks, AE_VAE which can be run locally on CPU, and VAE_rnn_cnn, which requires Colab with a GPU runtime.

AE_VAE.ipynb code will require the user to upload a single sample of an audio (.wav) file.

VAE_rnn_cnn.ipynb requires the user to run it on Colab and upload a folder of samples to Google drive in the same directory as the notebook.

The repo includes a small sample (input_audio.wav) that I created that can be used to test the models in AE_VAE.ipynb.
